Add USB controller for video calls using a Raspberry Pi Pico 

## What is it?
I spend a lot of time in online meetings using Microsoft Teams or Zoom. My microphone is usually muted if I'm not talking and often my camera is off, too. When someone asks me a question I sometimes have to fumble to quickly find and click the unmute and/or camera buttons on screen to jump into the meeting again. So I decided to create a custom USB controller with two buttons to toggle the camera and microphone on/off. After I started the project I also thought it would be useful to have volume control, too, so I made the entire controller into a volume dial. Finally, I added a toggle switch on the bottom to enable using the controller with either MS Teams or Zoom.

## Electrical
To be written, should include:
- Rotary encoder for volume control
- Push-buttons for mute/unmute and camera on/off
- Toggle switch for Teams/Zoom mode

## Mechanical
To be written, should include:
- 3D printable design
- Dial is a giant outer-gear
- Rotary encoder as an inside gear
- Buttons mounted to top cover, cover etched with icons
- Toggle switch on bottom, bottom etched with icons
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Cable strain relief

## Programming
